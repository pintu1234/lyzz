== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I choose which pages to display social buttons? =
Yes, in the options page you can choose which pages to display social buttons (pages, posts, media and any custom post type).

= The shortcode [cresta-social-share] doesn't work in a widget =
Most likely the theme you're using has not enabled the use of shortcodes within text-widget.<br/>
Try to add this snippet in your themeâ€™s functions.php:
`
add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');
`

= Can I hide the floating social buttons and only show the buttons in content? =
Yes, the floating social buttons can be hidden (from version 1.1).

= The plugin does not appear in home page =
The plugin does not appear in home page if the home shows the latest posts. Indeed, if the home page shows a static page, the plugin works correctly. (the option "show on: pages" must be enabled).

= Why social buttons are not shown in the posts list? (tags page, categories page, home feeds, etc ...) =
Because the plugin is designed to work exclusively on individual pages (single post, single page, single custom post type)
